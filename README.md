# AWS Solution Clickstream Analytics SDK for Flutter

## Introduction

Clickstream Flutter SDK can help you easily collect and report events from your mobile app to AWS. This SDK is part of an AWS solution - [Clickstream Analytics on AWS](https://github.com/awslabs/clickstream-analytics-on-aws), which provisions data pipeline to ingest and process event data into AWS services such as S3, Redshift.

The SDK relies on the [Clickstream Android SDK](https://github.com/awslabs/clickstream-android) and [Clickstream Swift SDK](https://github.com/awslabs/clickstream-swift). Therefore, flutter SDK also supports automatically collect common user events and attributes (e.g., session start, first open). In addition, we've added easy-to-use APIs to simplify data collection in Flutter apps.

## Integrate SDK

### Include SDK

```bash
flutter pub add clickstream_analytics
```

After complete, rebuild your Flutter application:

```bash
flutter run
```

### Initialize the SDK

Copy your configuration code from your clickstream solution web console, the configuration code should look like as follows. You can also manually add this code snippet and replace the values of appId and endpoint after you registered app to a data pipeline in the Clickstream Analytics solution console.

```dart
import 'package:clickstream_analytics/clickstream_analytics.dart';

final analytics = ClickstreamAnalytics();
analytics.init({
   appId: "your appId",
   endpoint: "https://example.com/collect"
});
```

Please noteï¼š

1. Your `appId` and `endpoint` are already set up in it.
2. We only need to initialize the SDK once after the application starts. It is recommended to do it in the main function of your App.
3. We can use `bool result = await analytics.init()` to get the boolean value of the initialization result.

### Start using

#### Record event

Add the following code where you need to record event.

```dart
import 'package:clickstream_analytics/clickstream_analytics.dart';

final analytics = ClickstreamAnalytics();

// record event with attributes
analytics.record(name: 'button_click', attributes: {
  "event_category": "shoes",
  "currency": "CNY",
  "value": 279.9
});

//record event with name
analytics.record(name: "button_click");
```

#### Login and logout

```dart
/// when user login success.
analytics.setUserId("userId");

/// when user logout
analytics.setUserId(null);
```

#### Add user attribute

```dart
analytics.setUserAttributes({
  "userName":"carl",
  "userAge": 22
});
```

When opening for the first time after integrating the SDK, you need to manually set the user attributes once, and current login user's attributes will be cached in native disk, so the next time browser open you don't need to set all user's attribute again, of course you can use the same api `analytics.setUserAttributes()` to update the current user's attribute when it changes.

#### Add global attribute

```dart
analytics.addGlobalAttributes({
  "_traffic_source_medium": "Search engine",
  "_traffic_source_name": "Summer promotion",
  "level": 10
});
```

It is recommended to set global attributes after each SDK initialization, global attributes will be included in all events that occur after it is set.

#### Other configurations

In addition to the required `appId` and `endpoint`, you can configure other information to get more customized usage:

```dart
final analytics = ClickstreamAnalytics();
analytics.init(
  appId: "your appId",
  endpoint: "https://example.com/collect",
  isLogEvents: false,
  isCompressEvents: false,
  sendEventsInterval: 5000,
  isTrackScreenViewEvents: true,
  isTrackUserEngagementEvents: true,
  isTrackAppExceptionEvents: false,
  authCookie: "your auth cookie",
  sessionTimeoutDuration: 1800000
);
```

Here is an explanation of each property:

- **appId (Required)**: the app id of your project in control plane.
- **endpoint (Required)**: the endpoint path you will upload the event to AWS server.
- **isLogEvents**: whether to print out event json for debugging, default is false.
- **isCompressEvents**: whether to compress event content when uploading events, default is `true`
- **sendEventsInterval**: event sending interval millisecond, works only bath send mode, the default value is `5000`
- **isTrackScreenViewEvents**: whether auto record screen view events in app, default is `true`
- **isTrackUserEngagementEvents**: whether auto record user engagement events in app, default is `true`
- **isTrackAppExceptionEvents**: whether auto track exception event in app, default is `false`
- **authCookie**: your auth cookie for AWS application load balancer auth cookie.
- **sessionTimeoutDuration**: the duration for session timeout millisecond, default is 1800000

#### Configuration update

You can update the default configuration after initializing the SDK, below are the additional configuration options you can customize.

```dart
final analytics = ClickstreamAnalytics();
analytics.updateConfigure(
    appId: "your appId",
    endpoint: "https://example.com/collect",
    isLogEvents: true,
    isCompressEvents: false,
    isTrackScreenViewEvents: false
    isTrackUserEngagementEvents: false,
    isTrackAppExceptionEvents: false,
    sessionTimeoutDuration: 100000,
    authCookie: "test cookie");
```

#### Send event immediately

```dart
final analytics = ClickstreamAnalytics();
analytics.flushEvents();
```
